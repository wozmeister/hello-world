hello world beginning repository

I am on a mission to master coding.
This is not my first attempt and actually I can code and have even been paid during a dev project
I guess my problem is motivation. Never really been motivated enough to code outside of work.
I always wanted to make my own game but the enormity of the project and the committment and dedication to the project
quickly tramples down and stomps all over any spark of motivation.
Oh well... lets see how I go this time.
